I am a Principle Data Scientist at [Seismic](https://seismic.com/), where I manage the AI/ML team.  You can read more about what I do on [Medium](https://medium.com/seismic-data-science/data-science-at-seismic-b4469c7cb6b0).

I also teach at UC San Diego as part of the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. I designed a class that is super fun: [DSC 96: Perspectives in Data Science](https://sites.google.com/view/dsc96), which I like describing as "big picture plus stuff that fell between the cracks in other classes".  I have also taught a large intro lecture class: [DSC 10: Principles of Data Science](https://sites.google.com/view/dsc10).  On official evaluations (UCSD CAPE), 96% of students said they would "recommend the instructor" in my classes.

To me, data science is about deeply understanding the meaning of your data, analyzing it with honesty and creativity, and communicating results clearly. I am currently a Principal Data Scientist at a company called Seismic, where I get to ship cloud based machine learning, search, and visualization products to thousands of enterprise customers. It is extremely gratifying to use data and math to help so many people make better decisions. 

You might like Seismic's Guiding Principles for Data Science or Books I Really Liked.

Fun

I am really good at doing stuff that I don't know how to do. Yet.

For example, with no real experience, my friends and I built a small cabin on Palomar Mountain.

Sometimes this approach to learning means I end up bleeding on things.  When that happens I document it on Twitter.
Older Stuff

I was very active with the San Diego Collaborative Arts Project for several years, culminating in being the president of the board of directors.  Here is an interview that I did that gives some details.

I used to do some "art" with the Dada Scientists.

I helped found a small intentional community called "The Normal House" and lived there for six years.  It was pretty great!

In addition to my dissertation, I also wrote a bunch of beer reviews.
