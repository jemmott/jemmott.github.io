# Data Science

To me, data science is about deeply understanding the meaning of your data, analyzing it with honesty and creativity, and communicating results clearly. It is extremely gratifying to use data and math to help so many people make better decisions. 

I currently have two data science jobs:

## Senior Data Scientist @ Seismic

I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Seismic](https://seismic.com/), where I manage the AI/ML team. 

As the product owner for AI/ML I set the team direction, implement the execution plan, manage risk, and communicate status.  I am a generalist on the technical side - recent tasks have varied from recommenders to search learning to rank, and from visualizations to NLP.  I ship code to production and do math on paper. 

You can read more stuff I wrote about Seismic: [what the Seismic data science team does](https://medium.com/seismic-data-science/data-science-at-seismic-b4469c7cb6b0) and [Seismic's Guiding Principles for Data Science](https://medium.com/seismic-data-science/seismics-guiding-principles-for-data-science-957ef54e064e).

## Lecturer @ UC San Diego

I [teach at UC San Diego](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/data_science_freshman_makes_his_first_cloud) as part of the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. I designed a class that is super fun: [DSC 96: Perspectives in Data Science](https://sites.google.com/view/dsc96), which I like describing as "big picture plus stuff that fell between the cracks in other classes".  

I have also taught a large intro lecture class: [DSC 10: Principles of Data Science](https://sites.google.com/view/dsc10) and designed and taught a seminar on technical presentations and interview skills [DSC 90](https://www.dsc90.com/).

On official evaluations (UCSD CAPE), 96% of students said they would "recommend the instructor" in my classes.

# Fun

I recently made an anti-recommender for Spotify: http://badplaylist.com/.  You can read more about it here: https://github.com/jemmott/badvibes

### Reading

I keep a list of [books I really liked](https://github.com/jemmott/books), which you might like too.  I am also pretty excited about the material on the [DSC96 reading list](https://sites.google.com/view/dsc96/reading).

### Learning

I am really good at doing stuff that I don't know how to do. Yet.

For example, with no real experience, my friends and I built [a small cabin on Palomar Mountain](https://www.normalhouse.com/palomar).

Sometimes this approach to learning means I end up bleeding on things.  When that happens I [document it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WhyIAmBleeding).

### Glass House

I live in the neighborhood of Del Dios, on the shores of Lake Hodges, in a house called the [Glass House](https://www.deldiosglasshouse.com/).  Most of my weekends are spent in the garden or the shop there.

### Older Stuff

I was very active with the [San Diego Collaborative Arts Project](http://www.sdcap.org/) for several years, culminating in being the president of the board of directors.  [Here](http://sdvoyager.com/interview/meet-colin-jemmott-san-diego-collaborative-arts-project-mission-valley/) is an interview that I did that gives some details.

I used to do some "art" with the [Dada Scientists](http://unfalsifiable.info/).

I helped found a small intentional community called "[The Normal House](https://www.normalhouse.com/)" and lived there for six years.  It was pretty great!

In addition to [my dissertation](http://www.lulu.com/shop/colin-jemmott/model-based-recursive-bayesian-state-estimation-for-single-hydrophone-passive-sonar-localization/ebook/product-17362495.html?ppn=1), I also wrote [a bunch of beer reviews](http://www.lulu.com/shop/colin-jemmott/501-beers/paperback/product-15326831.html).

I was Harvey Mudd's 2004 graduation speaker, and [recently found the video](https://youtu.be/PQDhr8k128I?t=783).
