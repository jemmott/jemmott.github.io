# Data Science

To me, data science is about deeply understanding the meaning of your data, analyzing it with honesty and creativity, and communicating results clearly. It is extremely gratifying to use data and math to help so many people make better decisions. 

Im April, 2020 I was on the UC San Diego Data Science Student Society's podcast.  It was super fun!  You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/7yHiQn4eqjy2EAzRNEmQdf) or read summary on [Medium](https://medium.com/ds3ucsd/launching-our-podcast-conversations-with-colin-jemmott-36c567659e8c). 

In June, 2020 I did my final lecture for UC San Diego's intro data science class, DSC10.  For that class I zoomed way out, and tried to answer questions my students had about data science in general.  You can watch that lecture [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xisjz2AqwCU).

# Previous Work

## Senior Data Scientist @ Seismic

Until July 2021 I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Seismic](https://seismic.com/), where I built recommender systems. 

As Seismic's first data scientist I did a lot of different stuff - from search learning to rank to deep learning, and from interactive visualizations to NLP.  I shiped code to production and did math on paper. 

You can read more stuff I wrote about Seismic: [what the Seismic data science team does](https://medium.com/seismic-data-science/data-science-at-seismic-b4469c7cb6b0) and [Seismic's Guiding Principles for Data Science](https://medium.com/seismic-data-science/seismics-guiding-principles-for-data-science-957ef54e064e).

## Lecturer @ UC San Diego

From Fall 2018 through March 2021 I [taught at UC San Diego](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/data_science_freshman_makes_his_first_cloud) as part of the undergraduate data science program in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. I designed a class that is super fun: [DSC 96: Perspectives in Data Science](https://www.dsc96.com/home), which I like describing as "intro-level big picture plus stuff that fell between the cracks in other classes".  You can watch the lectures from Fall 2020 [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2xVoaOLNqb0VG4GrqRw98GkLk4R_Kcx3).

I have also taught a large intro lecture class: [DSC 10: Principles of Data Science](https://sites.google.com/view/dsc10), designed and taught a seminar on technical presentations and interview skills [DSC 90](https://www.dsc90.com/), and Fall 2020 am running the senior capstone project track on recommender systems ([DSC180A](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20)).

On official evaluations (UCSD CAPE), 97% of students said they would "recommend the instructor" in my classes.

# Fun

A while ago, for a one-day hackathon, I made an anti-recommender for Spotify.  You can get your own customized bad-for-you playlist [here](http://badplaylist.com/) and read about it [here](https://github.com/jemmott/badvibes)

### Reading

I keep a list of [books I really liked](https://github.com/jemmott/books), which you might like too.  I am also pretty excited about the material on the [DSC96 reading list](https://sites.google.com/view/dsc96/reading).

### Learning

I am really good at doing stuff that I don't know how to do. Yet.

For example, with no real experience, my friends and I built [a small cabin on Palomar Mountain](https://www.deldiosglasshouse.com/palomar).

Sometimes this approach to learning means I end up bleeding on things.  When that happens I [document it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WhyIAmBleeding).

### Glass House

I live in the neighborhood of Del Dios, on the shores of Lake Hodges, in a house called the [Glass House](https://www.deldiosglasshouse.com/).  Most of my weekends are spent in the garden or the shop there.

### Older Stuff

I was very active with the [San Diego Collaborative Arts Project](http://www.sdcap.org/) for several years, culminating in being the president of the board of directors.  [Here](http://sdvoyager.com/interview/meet-colin-jemmott-san-diego-collaborative-arts-project-mission-valley/) is an interview that I did that gives some details.

I used to do some "art" with a group called the Dada Scientists. You can see some examples [here](https://sdcap.org/youtopia-2016-afterburn-report/dada-scientists/) and [here](https://sdcap.org/youtopia-2017-afterburn-report/2017-dada-scientists/).

I helped found a small intentional community called "[The Normal House](https://sdcap.org/our-house-your-canvas/)" and lived there for six years.  It was pretty great!

In addition to [my dissertation](http://www.lulu.com/shop/colin-jemmott/model-based-recursive-bayesian-state-estimation-for-single-hydrophone-passive-sonar-localization/ebook/product-17362495.html?ppn=1), I also wrote [a bunch of beer reviews](http://www.lulu.com/shop/colin-jemmott/501-beers/paperback/product-15326831.html).

All my academic publications, conference presentations, and awards are listed [here](http://www.cjemmott.com/publications).

I was Harvey Mudd's 2004 graduation speaker, and [recently found the video](https://youtu.be/PQDhr8k128I?t=783).
